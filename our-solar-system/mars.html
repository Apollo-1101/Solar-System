          Mars is the fourth planet from the Sun and the second-smallest planet
          in the Solar System after Mercury.

      <p>
        In English, Mars carries a name of the Roman god of war, and is often
        referred to as the <em>Red Planet</em> because the iron oxide prevalent
        on its surface gives it a reddish appearance that is distinctive among
        the astronomical bodies visible to the naked eye.
      </p>

      <h2 class="mars-title">Orbit and rotation</h2>
      <h3>Rotation</h3>
      <p>
        Mars's average distance from the Sun is roughly 230 million km (143
        million mi), and its orbital period is 687 (Earth) days. The solar day
        (or sol) on Mars is only slightly longer than an Earth day: 24 hours, 39
        minutes, and 35.244 seconds. A Martian year is equal to 1.8809 Earth
        years, or 1 year, 320 days, and 18.2 hours.
      </p>
      <p>
        The axial tilt of Mars is 25.19 degrees relative to its orbital plane,
        which is similar to the axial tilt of Earth. As a result, Mars has
        seasons like Earth, though on Mars they are nearly twice as long because
        its orbital period is that much longer. In the present day epoch, the
        orientation of the north pole of Mars is close to the star Deneb.
      </p>
      <div class="parallax-g1"></div>
      <h3>Orbit</h3>
      <p>
        Mars has a relatively pronounced orbital eccentricity of about 0.09; of
        the seven other planets in the Solar System, only Mercury has a larger
        orbital eccentricity. It is known that in the past, Mars has had a much
        more circular orbit. At one point, 1.35 million Earth years ago, Mars
        had an eccentricity of roughly 0.002, much less than that of Earth
        today. Mars's cycle of eccentricity is 96,000 Earth years compared to
        Earth's cycle of 100,000 years. Mars has a much longer cycle of
        eccentricity, with a period of 2.2 million Earth years, and this
        overshadows the 96,000-year cycle in the eccentricity graphs. For the
        last 35,000 years, the orbit of Mars has been getting slightly more
        eccentric because of the gravitational effects of the other planets. The
        closest distance between Earth and Mars will continue to mildly decrease
        for the next 25,000 years.
